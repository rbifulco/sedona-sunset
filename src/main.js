 * below a threshold rather than decaying forever, head bob is reset to phase

 * controller would fight the mouse for as long as you held the view, which is
 * the thing that would read as being taken over.
 *
 * It only moves while you are walking *forward*. Stand still and it is exactly
 * inert, which is also why it cannot touch the record: the capture harness

 *
 * It is on **height and not pitch**, deliberately. The arrival lift spends a
 * bounded budget of pitch over the last forty-five metres and never pushes back
 * once spent; a settle that also wrote pitch would be drawing on a different
 * pocket of the same quantity, and the two would compose into something neither
 * of them describes. Nothing here touches `player.pitch`.
 *
 * It is a critically damped spring given an initial *velocity* rather than a
 * displacement, which is both the physical model — the impact hands the camera
 * downward speed and the legs arrest it — and the reason there is no pop. A
 * displacement would drop the eye instantly on the landing frame. The spring
 * takes 1/w to reach its lowest point, so the dip has a rise time.
 *
 * The amplitude therefore scales with how hard you land, for free and without a
 * curve to tune: peak dip is about 0.37 * v0 / w. A 3.4 m/s arrival on the flat
 * dips 3.9 cm, the 1.8 m/s clip off the cut bank dips 2.0 cm. A settle identical
 * either way is the thing that reads as an animation instead of a body.
